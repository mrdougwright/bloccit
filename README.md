# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills.

Made with help from [Bloc](http://bloc.io)
Hosted by Heroku [here](http://sheltered-forest-8124.herokuapp.com/)

Notes:
  Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
